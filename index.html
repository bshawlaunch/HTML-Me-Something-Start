            But first, a little bit about me.... After losing my job during Covid, I dedicated all of my time into learning how to develop apps. 
            Not being a computer science major, and no real experience to backup my knowledge, I quickly realized I was going to have some trouble
            landing my first job in the field. I wanted to travel, and I still needed to make money, so I started my own expediting company. I 
            offered my services to a few different carriers, got a van, and before I knew it, I got my first load. I grabbed the dog, and a few 
            essentials, and off we went. These are some of the cool places we've visited.
